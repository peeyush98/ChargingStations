# ChargingStations

My goal for this project is to predict if there is an electric charging station at a given zipcode or not and how many electric stations are present at that zipcode.

In the charging stations dataset there are very few variables which are related to electric charging stations. So, i wanted to check if factors like populations, house prices, income etc were a factor in having an electric charging station in the area.

So, I found an income dataset, population dataset, house prices dataset and a poverty dataset and merged them to the charging stations dataset. Used this final merged dataset to to gain valuable insights and make predictions.

Everything I did along with my thought process of why I did what I did is in the ipynb file.
